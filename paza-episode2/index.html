<p>Now let&#8217;s get into today&#8217;s topic of discussion&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Thank you very much for joining our platform this afternoon. The compensation for this afternoon&#8217;s podcast is feminism, women with disabilities and health and mainly exploring the experiences of women with disabilities, particularly in light of this global pandemic. And with us this afternoon, we&#8217;re very pleased to have amazing, amazing strong women with disabilities. And I would like them to begin with some introduction. So Abby, do you mind introducing yourself</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby</em></strong><strong>: </strong>My name is Abby. I&#8217;m born and bred in Kenya. I&#8217;ve started a project called walking autism, which is to raise awareness of autism across Kenya and eventually, hopefully the continent. And thank you very much for inviting me to this podcast. I look forward to contributing.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Thank you very much, Abby. Marie Njeri, do you mind introducing yourself? Sure.</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Njeri</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Thank you for having me. Again my name is Maria Njeri. I live with Cerebral Palsy and I manage my own awareness and advocacy organization known as Njeri Maria Foundation, we focus on children and people living with Cerebral palsy and how to access early intervention and the right support system also known as a noise maker in Kenya</p>



<p><strong><em>Andrea</em></strong>: So my name is Andrea Parra and I am an attorney by training and I have been an activist around issues related to disability since 2001. But I&#8217;ve had the possibility to work with different collective organizations of women with disabilities and my area of focus and work is the intersection between gender and disability and a mainly for an advocacy perspective because I don&#8217;t identify as a person with a disability. And more. So I&#8217;ve tried to work more from, from an allied technical perspective supporting groups of, and collectives of people with disabilities in their advocacy work to try to understand the law and the international human rights standards</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie:</em></strong> Great, thank you. So, as you know, my name is Lizzie Kiama, and I am the Founder and Managing Trustee at This Ability Trust, where we work to advance the rights of women and girls with disabilities. And the reason we came up with the idea for a podcast was in light of the work that we do around creating visibility for the rights of women and girls with disabilities and also providing access to information and particularly in light of the global pandemic. The situation with the corona virus, we felt that it was important to begin to document meant experiences of women with disabilities in emergency health situations. And therefore, we are speaking every two weeks with groups of women with disabilities and other stakeholders. And we&#8217;re very thankful that you, you all were able to join us this afternoon. So I&#8217;ll start with you, Abby. And maybe if you could, share how communities of individuals and children with autism with autism, especially women, how are they experiencing life in quarantined within this global pandemic?</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby:</em></strong> Yeah, thank you. Thanks, Lizzie. So in terms of autism, with it still still being quite a not very well known. You know, not too much you&#8217;d known about it. So, so services at any way in Kenya quite lacking, especially when it comes to adults with disabilities because of there hasn&#8217;t been too many out, you know, people who women in contextual women who want to disclose that information, because it&#8217;s still quite a taboo subject. So in terms of general support, there is very little and in terms of with this the quarantined Yeah, there is very little support and especially for the majority of Kenyans who, you know, can&#8217;t access many of the services. Very little help and, and, of course, many of the caregivers, mothers and caregivers who look after the children with autism. There&#8217;s does not much support at all.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Great, thank you. Do you mind talking from a personal experience? Like what what has it been like for you even from a mental health standpoint?</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby:</em></strong>&nbsp; Sure. So for me with the nature of autism, it is very, like we enjoy being by ourselves a lot and so this Quarantine, it&#8217;s good, but it&#8217;s draining, you know, I keep myself busy. I&#8217;m always working on something. But so, you know, I don&#8217;t mind it too much, but it&#8217;s getting a little too much. It&#8217;s, you know, missing people were missed. And of course, not being able to travel. I can&#8217;t be able to, you know, for example, come to Nairobi and do lots of meetings I had planned, which is frustrating, right? But this is where the Internet comes, you know, we&#8217;re so lucky to have this technology when we didn&#8217;t know.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong><strong>: </strong>&nbsp;Yeah. You mentioned the nature of autism, could you maybe unpack what that is? Because we&#8217;re assuming that everyone knows what autism is</p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;<em>Abby:</em></strong>&nbsp; My apologies. So, autism is a spectrum of various disabilities. And, you know, people I get the message wrong that there is either I&#8217;d say the nonverbal or the very high high needs to the Albert Einstein, end of the spectrum, so, so, but it&#8217;s a variety of spectrums. I mean, you can have someone say who is nonverbal but extremely articulate and very smart and I&#8217;ve read a number of books by non speaking individuals and, and they come up with some incredible explanations as to why and how they feel. So it&#8217;s that misconception of seeing a nonverbal and just assuming so so there&#8217;s that. And there is their behavior. Their behavior is quite a big I hate to say the word red flag, but that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the doctor version of it. But also behavior like sometimes I often do too repetitive stuff like, like, people like routine with autism. And then a routine is disrupted in any way. Like, say this. Corona, Corona virus. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s Charles help with autism is his or her routine is disrupted. So it can be very hard and communication. Also, that&#8217;s another thing about them and and yeah, like I was saying before you, you know you be assumption that if someone is nonverbal they that they&#8217;re not able to understand or this or that, that&#8217;s wrong as well.</p>



<p>Like I learned to talk very, I was a three when I learned to talk and still always very mixed up jumbled. And so some of us do, gain speech and others. Not quite able to get there but that&#8217;s when they&#8217;re letting a matter number of different tools can be used in place of speech. Sorry, I hope I made sense.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Yes you did. Yes he did. And just hold on to your comment about tools and and you know, that can support individuals with autism. Let&#8217;s pick that up a bit later. But Maria, Maria Njeri. Do you mind? taking us through the challenges that women and girls with cerebral palsy in this context of the corona virus? Could you tell us about some of the experiences?</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Njeri</em></strong><em>: </em>Cerebral palsy falls into two categories in disability, it can be either a physical disability, an intellectual disability. So, we&#8217;ll have always even in normal circumstances had a hard time how do we define it how do intervene for it for And also that has become the challenge in this time of the pandemic because one of the curses for people for women and girls with Cerebral palsy who have more of a physical impairment, then their access to health care such as therapy service. Medication has been limited and for those with intellectual disability, we are finding they&#8217;re becoming more venerable. But because of the social distancing and now there more at home, the more unsupervised. and so I think so the two main problems women with CP are facing.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Thank you. Thank you, Maria. I know we&#8217;ve had this conversation and even in the last</p>



<p>session that we had, the situation around violence, gender based and sexual violence for girls, particularly those with intellectual disabilities was a big concern, particularly now that people are confined to their homes and sometimes they&#8217;re confined with the perpetrators of this violence and they have no escape. So it was definitely something of concern.</p>



<p>Maria Rosa, do you mind telling us how feminism can play a role in ensuring that we advance health rights for women with disability? And why should we take a feminist approach to this conversation?</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Rosa</em></strong><strong>:&nbsp; </strong>Hi, everybody. Thank you, Lizzie. I think it&#8217;s now the crisis that we&#8217;re living now is showing us in a very, direct way, and also cruel way that woman and girls are not in this same condition than men. And yeah, especially if we are talking about women and girls with disability, for sure they are not in the same conditions than the men. So a feminist perspective or a feminist approach can help us to see I mean, the difference that we are living only because our gender you know, if you born a woman, you don&#8217;t have the same options than men. If you are a girl with disability and the rural areas, maybe for for you it&#8217;s much more complicated to access to health care, or also to information or even to new technologies that can teach you how to handle the crisis. So I think a feminist perspective can help us to see to try to see the reality of woman and by the other side. I mean, we women have a long story trying to build support networks. So I think Yeah, trying to see the the crisis from a feminist perspective can also also show us how to build these support networks, how to work together, how to, yeah, how to handle this new situation that we are living now and how to support each other and yeah, I think something that is also very important is now in the middle of these quarantined. The gender-based violence is growing a lot. So this is another thing that women are living now, and I mean, now it&#8217;s time to see what is happening and to do something about it, I think.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Thank you, thank you, in continuing the discussion around sexual and gender based violence, and for both you Abby and Maria Njeri, some of the issues around legal capacity, you know, that affect the bodily autonomy and decision making of women and girls with disabilities regardless of of the context, but especially when it comes to guardianship and caregiver situations, how are some of the ways that communities or individuals with either CP or autism can begin to protect themselves and I know it&#8217;s it comes from Accessing knowledge and information, but how what are some some other practical tips or resources that, you know you can share that these communities can can arm themselves with?</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby:</em></strong><strong> </strong>Okay, I&#8217;ll go. So, of course it costs a lot depends on where we&#8217;re about, you know, person is either in the rural areas or in more cities where, you know, like, say technologies to, for instance, groups, especially for caregivers and parents with autistic children. I think support makes all the difference and I know a number of mothers with autistic children who have have a online support group. And, you know, it makes all the difference when you have someone who understands and who you can talk to and like you communicate with them a fair amount, and we help each other and that&#8217;s the power of community and in some rural areas that around the country, sadly, that isn&#8217;t happening just yet. So, I think the way forward is to try and encourage trying to encourage parents, caregivers and you know Autistic women themselves. Though, of course, as I said before, many, many individuals don&#8217;t like to know they have nowhere to turn. There&#8217;s no one to talk to, and that ends up becoming very isolating and it is community that helps. So I would suggest your other support groups finding support groups and creating one and that&#8217;s what I learned from me as well. And personal speaking until I did, you know, join Facebook groups and met with parents and individuals who work with the spectrum in Kenya. It was very isolating for me.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie:</em></strong><strong> </strong>So just picking up on that, before you respond, Marie Njeri, Abby, when when you&#8217;re talking when you speak about support, the support is directed at who the caregivers and guardians or to the individual with disability or without Autism,</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Of course, should be both ideally. But as, as in Kenya that as of right now in Kenya, there aren&#8217;t very many women, girls, women, or girls with disability who, who are, who feel comfortable in opening up that discussion, because of the stigma and discrimination around it. And I have, you know, given talks to parents who, who are try to encourage them, you know, explain it to your children, talk to your children, and talk to girls about it and, and give them that. That courage to want to find others. Yeah. Sadly, it&#8217;s a very not talked about issue here. So I personally only know two other autistic women in Kenya. And I&#8217;m sure there are loads tons more. But there&#8217;s just that stigma still about really opening up to two. And I&#8217;m letting people know. Yes, I guess I have this. It&#8217;s not easy.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp; Thank you. Thank you. Njeri do you have something to add?</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Njeri</em></strong><strong>:</strong> I think that was profound. And I think to emphasis on what Abby is saying on support system and having the right support system is &nbsp;Not only you, for &nbsp;girl or woman with the different disabilities but for the people who are closest to her, because the people who are closes to are her are the biggest to enablers so if they support her and her decisions then that’s the way to go but also another thing next to add on that is the cultural and the medical perspectives of it and having the right processes and systems for them to access&nbsp; the care they need and Lizzie if you don’t mind I have a story about a young lady I met.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong><strong>:</strong> l don&#8217;t mind go ahead.</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Njeri</em></strong>: She has cerebral palsy, but she has an Intellectual impairment and she sells her body in order to get food or to get a daily living and now she is pregnant with her second child and so the family approached me with a request on as he gets her second child can the doctor perform a medical what do we call it a medical intervention so that she does not have another children</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong><strong>:</strong> To sterilize, basically. Yeah.</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Njeri</em></strong><strong>:</strong> My first question was, is that what you want? They told me no, she can’t have other children because she can’t take care of them and we have to take care of their children to them. They had even involved the chief and all that, so I went back to the thinking about it from a cultural aspect and how we always say we never want to talk about a woman with disabilities as a woman or as a mother and we just take that credit from them I think a way I could provide the right processes how to go about all this. Does it make sense?</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie:</em></strong> Yes, it does make sense. I&#8217;m curious about is the is the conversation still going on with this woman or did they arrive at a decision? What was the conclusion?</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Njeri:</em></strong><strong> </strong>The conversations still going on we ensured that she got proper pre marital care that she needed and now we are waiting also another thing. Lizzie there no written legal document of how to go about sterilization of a woman with disabilities we don’t know how to go about it do we do we need a letter from the chief or do we need to go see a Magistrate there is no legal document on such a procedure</p>



<p><strong><em>Andrea</em></strong>: I think that is a very common situation, also for us here in Latin America, and I think what you bring up and I think your instinct is completely right about first establishing what she wants, and the problem and this is the whole issue around informed consent to specific procedures. Both abortion and sterilization are procedures that only the person whose body is involved should be able to consent to. And the problem is that many times the information that women with disabilities receive is wrong. So they are misinformed about what this procedure means and about what that what that entails for them. So many times women with disabilities are told that they need to be sterilized. Because of health reasons, and when that doesn&#8217;t have any, any grounds there is a routine a and preference on the both on medical personnel families to want to sterilize women so others don&#8217;t have to take care of their children, which also involves a stereotype about women&#8217;s with disabilities, inability to be mothers.</p>



<p>So I think that is very important first, to ensure that this person has the right information about what she&#8217;s what the procedure is about, do. I think many times it is true that women with disabilities and get pregnant as a result of sexual violence, so I think that&#8217;s another thing to screen for. In this situation, if and what happens also, that is a very structural problem is that because women with disabilities have very little access to regular education and inclusive education. They receive very little information about sexuality and sexual education.</p>



<p>Like for example, in Colombia, it is mandatory for all schools to teach about sexuality, and which is very controversial, but there&#8217;s a big campaign on that on the part of activists for comprehensive sexual ed in schools, but because women with disabilities are excluded from the schooling system, they don&#8217;t have spaces where they receive information. One project that we worked on here was with the main sexual reproductive health care provider to create they have like a program for youth and education youth and we we worked with them for them to develop and include in their Sex Ed programs, young people with disabilities they are learning about their bodies and sexuality</p>



<p>So I don&#8217;t know this the specific situation of this person and of course, you know much more, what is the cultural context that she&#8217;s in? But I think the first step would be to check that she has the right information that this is a if this is a wanted pregnancy then she has a right to exercise, parental rights and maternity, and this is one one legal framework you were asking for I would recommend reading is the is the general common number three of the of the UN Committee on the Rights of People with Disabilities, which focuses on women and girls with disabilities.</p>



<p>Also the Special Rapporteurs report on Sexual and Reproductive Rights and of girls and young people, young women with disabilities has very clear guidelines about education and about informed consent. So the first thing I would say is to first establish what she knows her rights are what she wants to do, whether she wants to be a mother or not. And there&#8217;s a whole question of accessibility of information. No medical personnel should go ahead with a procedure without her direct consent, which is also the other problem that we were facing here in Colombia with guardianship laws that allow for a third party to consent to different procedures. So that&#8217;s what I would say, to begin with, I don&#8217;t know specifically to which authority if the chief has specifically or because I&#8217;m not that familiar with the local context, but I would first establish whether there has been informed consent properly and on that there are very clearly standards on what is what is important consent, and what she what information she has to make this decision to make this an informed decision. And what she wants specifically, before taking any steps before authorities or medical personnel.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie:</em></strong> Thank you very much</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Just to add on to both Maria and Andreas point about the right sexual education and for disabled women, very much so, we need that a lot here. And the right, of course, the education that could be understood by persons with autism, by women with autism. And other Intellectual Disabilities, you know? Because as we all know, I&#8217;m talking about sex Anyway, here is quite a taboo subject. So people don&#8217;t do it. And and when it comes to the disabled girls and women, of course, it&#8217;s totally, no one even goes there. No one thinks that, you know, as disabled women, we have these needs, we have these rights. But of course right now, that&#8217;s not not considered.</p>



<p><strong><em>Andrea:</em></strong> I think that&#8217;s so important. And I think one one strategy that we had here because in all honesty, the disability rights movement doesn&#8217;t have as much capacity to cover, like, a whole national context or anything like that. So what we did to actually was to To first like advocate before the main sexual reproductive health care provider, which is a, which I think in in Kenya, it&#8217;s Marie Stopes, or there&#8217;s an IPPF affiliates in Kenya. So those like who so what we did is because this organization has been around for many, many years here in Colombia, and they cover the whole country, they have clinics and offices in the whole country. So what we first did was to ally with them, so we trained their personnel first, and we&#8217;ve developed materials with them so they would start including protocols for providing services to women with disabilities across their clinics. So that was a way in which is not only DPOs and people on the ground trying to, you know, provide Sex Ed to other people with disabilities because we don&#8217;t like there&#8217;s no days and capacity or resources as much as these organizations that have been around for much longer</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Definitely, yeah, we need to start doing that and and finding ways to for for women and girls who learn different ways we need to find different ways of absolutely bringing that conversation to them in ways that they understand and and they can, speak for themselves.</p>



<p><strong><em>Andrea:</em></strong> And there&#8217;s actually pretty good material that it&#8217;s accessible sexual education for that gets in, in easy to read materials and like there&#8217;s actually good material in English especially. One that&#8217;s one thing we struggled with is that in Spanish, we don&#8217;t have a lot of material. But in English, there&#8217;s already a lot of good material on Sex Ed for, for people with intellectual and Psychosocial disabilities</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby:</em></strong> I Have a look at some of them. That&#8217;s good ones. Yeah.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Great. Thanks, Maria Njeri, do you feel like your question was answered? Do you feel like you have a way forward?</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Njeri:</em></strong> Yes I have a way forward, but I have, one question maybe she ahs intellectual impairment an informed consent is abit challenging so how do we go about that also I think the third party rule applies here that the mother or the father or the care giver have the consent over her. So how do we go around that?</p>



<p><strong><em>Andrea:</em></strong> Um, so first off, I think the question of, how to form the informed consent of her that&#8217;s a question of accessible information in the premise is that every person has a wheel, and that every person can express what they want and what they prefer. So the core of the convention is that we focus on a person&#8217;s will and preferences. So, this doesn&#8217;t mean that a person has to understand a medical contract, and then small letter that not even people without disabilities understand. So that doesn&#8217;t it. That&#8217;s not the point. The point is that there is a way to establish communication and sometimes with people who have been isolated for a long time in their lives. This can be tricky, but we did a project here in a pilot project. With 65 people with intellectual psychosocial disabilities in various situations, many people had been isolated in their rooms for their whole lives and what happened is there was a team of people who started like getting close to the person building trust, doing like dreams charts, and starting to identify their network of support. The quote, the problem with decades that you have money is that it&#8217;s the pregnant woman and pregnancy is a situation that is against the clock. So but so I, I didn&#8217;t understand very well if the question was whether she wanted to have an abortion or whether she wanted to be sterilized during delivery. And so those are two different situations. If the question is abortion, it then fast things need to be done because the pregnancy advances quickly, right. You only have a very limited space of time. If the question is the sterilization, sterilization is not a procedure that has to happen during delivery. And you can argue that until she expresses informed consent, that procedure doesn&#8217;t need to happen. Sterilization, if that&#8217;s what she wants later, she can have it still. That&#8217;s not that&#8217;s, that doesn&#8217;t have to be during delivery. And my question would be, is, is there a reason why the parents are consenting because she&#8217;s under guardianship legally,</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Njeri:</em></strong><strong> </strong>She’s under guardianship and she’s also dependant on her family</p>



<p><strong><em>Andrea:</em></strong> Yeah, dependency doesn&#8217;t mean that you don&#8217;t have legal capacity dependency, dependency is you can be in a very autonomous person and have dependency needs for your dress or your food feeding and what not. But the fact that you&#8217;re dependent doesn&#8217;t make you a incapacitated, per se, so if she has legal guardianship, we had the same situation here, and we had to fight it, especially. And I think right now, and I think it is possible to argue and we did it here before when we see had guardianship because we were able to pass a law that eliminates guardianship last year. But we have the same situation. And what we would argue is we would file a challenge before courts saying that even if you&#8217;re under guardianship, decisions over your sexuality and over your integrity and your bodily integrity should not be allowed to be guard made by the guardians, even if they can make economic and financial decisions legally. So that&#8217;s a fight.</p>



<p>We had the exact same situation that you&#8217;re saying. And a lot of parents were the ones authorized by authorizing sterilization, and abortions and things that were very intimate and personal and that only the person who&#8217;s buying these involves able to make. So I think that&#8217;s probably a fight. I&#8217;m not gonna deny that and it&#8217;s probably a fight before the courts to establish some standard that although the Kenya the Kenyan Supreme Court has some good decisions on sexual reproductive rights, so I think you can use Kenyan law. So I think that that if if the parents are insisting on sterilization, and she&#8217;s it&#8217;s not what you want, I think you need to go into a legal fights, unfortunately But that&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve made a lot of the wins. So I&#8217;m happy to put you in touch if that&#8217;s helpful. And but I think that that, yeah, I mean, I think we need to fight for it. Even if there is a call, even if we are in countries where guardianship is still allowable. We shouldn&#8217;t allow for very intimate decisions to be made by guardians. And actually, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s several like medical statements about sterilization should only be made by the person who&#8217;s been sterilized, etc.</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Njeri:</em></strong><strong> </strong>&nbsp;Super. Thank you.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong><strong>: </strong>Prepare for a fight Njeri.</p>



<p><strong><em>Andrea:</em></strong> But probably everybody in this call is a fighter already. So</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong>: We were going to go into how women with disabilities are accessing information particularly within this, this kind of situation and the stories around that but I think the story that Maria Njeri brought up, covers that so I will just go into the next bit in terms of other opportunities to create visibility for some of the issues that are happening now. And probably even riding on what the fight that you&#8217;re about to get into Maria&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Njeri:</em></strong> I think I can start with that one of course opportunity for visibilities’ of&nbsp; women with disabilities are always there and it&nbsp; goes without saying awareness and also access to the accurate information without this two visibility is not there and I guess and as we are speaking am thinking we are expert of knowledge and experts of experience and if I Andrea can&nbsp; share the information Abby and you Lizzie can we can have a strong impact on it</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby</em></strong><strong>:</strong> I definitely agree with Maria. You know, there’s always opportunities and the more visible we as disabled women are and can bring forth these discussions and consensus conversations. I think though we can we can move forward. It will be fight but you know we can do it with we women can do</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie:</em></strong> In terms of increasing visibility and the access to information, particularly now that people are confined to their homes and you know, we are adhering to the social distancing. Are there some innovative tools or, tips on how women with disabilities or persons with disabilities in general can begin to access information, because we&#8217;ve had complaints of you know, government addresses around the corona virus, not accessible to various groups of individuals with disabilities sign language is not being provided, and information is being sent either via social media.</p>



<p>So the assumption is everyone has access to Internet, which is not true. Or, you know, the Ministry of Health is sending mass SMS is on mobile mobile phones so the assumption is everyone is literate. Everyone has access to mobile phones or Internet. How else can we? What what what strategies or solutions can you share with possibly the listeners of this conversation?</p>



<p><strong><em>Andrea:</em></strong> And so I think these type of conversations are key, I think that it is true the the question of access to technology is very tricky. And but I think that like low tech options like just phone calls and like conference calls are one option. And like also putting together for people who do have access to internet like information about their members like who is out there who they need to call or they need to reach out to try to figure out I&#8217;m pasting in the chat. I give this to my arrows to the this resources that I that International Disability Alliance is compiling on covert and disability which I think has been information on specifically targeting women with disabilities. But here we&#8217;ve also had to fight like the president didn&#8217;t have sign language in the initial things and so or sometimes media when the sign language was next to the person speaking, they would just cut them off the screen. It&#8217;s like things like that we see here a lot also. So we&#8217;ve been using trying to use social media also to challenge those behaviors. We went to a meeting with the mayor&#8217;s office, and that is doing a lot of their aid like giving groceries and things to people who are impacted by this situation and also demand that accessibility of all information and they&#8217;ve done somewhat okay job, but I think we need us civil society to keep pressuring about this.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie:</em></strong><strong> </strong>Thank you, Andrea. Anyone else?</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby:</em></strong> Um, I think the more we have these type of conversations and and by our pages and, of course, I&#8217;m talking for people with access to technology. But I also think if it isn&#8217;t doing like, even zoom interviews with various media houses in Kenya, like interviews, maybe we could infuse, I&#8217;ve tried to get a number going because this month is world Autism Awareness Month. So I&#8217;m trying to get a few you know, zoom interviews or whatever going with some of these because, because that is another way of reaching out to people and getting awareness out there. Yeah.</p>



<p><strong><em>Millicent:</em></strong> Just to add on to it, I think because looking at the Kenyan setup, like the rural set up, I think it&#8217;s important for this information also to be given out in a language that the women understand because if you look at the bulk SMS that the government is sending out there in English, the assumption is everybody will be able to read and understand which is not the case. So I think it&#8217;s also important Yeah, to make use of Yeah, of language that is, you know, understandable, and, like we have our local radio stations that is listened especially in the rural areas, covering different regions. So I think that is also should be a mode medium that they could use to pass the information. And this speaks in the vernacular languages. So it is more clearer and more understandable. It will speak to them.</p>



<p><strong><em>Andrea:</em></strong> Yeah, I think a community radio is a great option. And also translation to local languages is a key.</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Very much so. I definitely agree that needs to.</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Njeri</em></strong>: Yeah, I wanted to thank you Millicent for mentioning that but also going back to the basic remember how urgent information used to be given out by the elders of the community or by the gate keeper so it will be very nice to see ministry of health using the community gate keepers to send out information so that will be another way</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie:</em></strong> Great. Um, Maria Rosa, do you have anything to add?</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Rosa:</em></strong> No, not really. I just want to thank everybody. I learned a lot from all of you now. And yeah, I think now we have, every time that we develop a new podcast, we have more and more questions, and more and more ideas. And again, that&#8217;s good for everybody.</p>



<p><strong><em>Andrea</em></strong><strong>: </strong>I think it&#8217;d be a good idea to look at the African regional body and to see what the human rights standards in the in the regional body are good, and some are good, some are good in disability and some are good on gender. So I think using those, that framework is also useful for the African region.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie:</em></strong> Great, great. Okay. So this was around access to information and creating visibility. And, Abby, you mentioned, the world Autism Awareness Day. That is coming up. If there&#8217;s any way we can support if even if it just amplifying it on our social media, Maria the same as yourself, you know, it would be nice to support one another, particularly now that we&#8217;re all stuck at home working online. That&#8217;s least I think we can do. So I think it&#8217;ll be useful to share some of these, the things that you&#8217;re working on and see how the rest of us can amplify your early. Yeah, definitely.</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby</em></strong>: So I have a page on Face book where I post various articles regarding autism and the rights and, and information but as Maria pointed out, the right is information, because we all know there&#8217;s a lot of the wrong information out there. So it&#8217;s what I post mainly is from self advocates, and I do books on women&#8217;s right.</p>



<p><strong><em>Andrea:</em></strong> Abby, What’s the Facebook page?</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Walking Autism. It&#8217;s my project. It&#8217;s a project for the page. Walking Autism. So yeah, if you want to check it out and share some of those, so it would be that would be helpful. Yeah,</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby:</em></strong> Yeah, but thank you so much for including me in this conversation .I look forward to many more.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie:</em></strong> Yes, definitely. Marie Njeri, do you have any anything to add about the work that you do?</p>



<p><strong><em>Maria Njeri:</em></strong><strong> </strong>Because a lot of the work probably we do is out in the field so that has stopped being rescheduled but you can follow me on Twitter. @NjeriMaria2 on Facebook @ MariaNjeri and Yeah, I think I just want to say the fight continues</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie:</em></strong> It does. We&#8217;ll get them. We fighters. Yeah.</p>



<p><strong><em>Abby:</em></strong> Our ancestors didn&#8217;t fight for nothing. Carry on flight.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie:</em></strong> Andrea, Any any parting words?</p>



<p><strong><em>Andrea:</em></strong> No, just a pleasure to be here. Thank you, Liz, for your patience and for inviting me. I really hope that we can maybe mediate some conversations with some of the Latin American groups. I&#8217;m happy to support translation and stuff. So please keep me in mind for that. I know that a many people here would appreciate also having that kind of exchange.</p>



<p><strong><em>Lizzie</em></strong> That would be great. Yeah, I think we can definitely figure that out. So thank you very much and with that I&#8217;d like to close this</p>

Through her own experiences as a differently-abled woman, she has great experience working to develop disability-inclusion strategies for organizations. In addition to the wheelchair sports, the project will also incorporate interactive workshops on gender-based violence, sexual &amp; reproductive rights, leadership and empowerment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lizzie was first introduced to wheelchair rugby in the United States &nbsp;by Mobility International USA through a program called Women\u2019s Institute on Leadership and Disability (WILD). &nbsp;Using what she gained from WILD, plus her experience in the disability field,&nbsp;Lizzie created a successful workshop that integrated both standard and differently-abled women in this unique sport. The hunger for this subject is strong in Kenya, as adaptive sports are rarely available, and when they are, they are generally reserved for men. She is already planning her next workshop in March, and has collaborated with the Ministry of Sports in Kenya, Blaze Sports America and a team of experts that are happy to volunteer their skills to the participants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI believe this project will give both disabled and non-disabled women and girls the motivation and drive to pursue their rights\u201d says Kiama, \u201cwhile also enabling access to opportunities that have been reserved for more able bodies and more often male members of the community.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The funds from The Pollination Project will be used to expand the project and their ability to reach more people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>GRANT AWARD DATE: &nbsp;DECEMBER 11, 2013<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lizzie Kiama founded the\u00a0Women &amp; Wheels Project\u00a0to open up wheelchair sports to women and girls both with and without disabilities in Nairobi, Kenya.

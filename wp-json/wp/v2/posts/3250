I would just like with a round of\nintroductions I\u2019ll start with you Ash. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Ash<\/em><\/strong>: This is Aiswarya Rao. I&#8217;m a pediatrician and I&#8217;m a woman with the locomotive disability. I&#8217;m calling from Chennai, that is in South India. So that&#8217;s about me, I run a shelter for women with disability in Chennai. We have about at any point of time 60 women with all kinds of disabilities staying in the shelter with us. And what we are looking for, primarily, through the shelter is employability of women of different capacities better employment opportunities. So that&#8217;s about me. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: Great. Thank you so much Ash. And Sophie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Sophie<\/em><\/strong>: Hi\neverybody. I&#8217;m Sophie Morgan. I&#8217;m from the UK. I&#8217;m a disability advocate, and\nalso an activist campaigner. I work mostly in the media myself, advocating for\nbetter representation for disabled people but also work in retail and travel to\nhelp improve representation. They&#8217;re for disabled people too. So yeah, I&#8217;m\nbased in London.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: Thank you very much, everybody. And for those who do not know me, my name is Lizzie Kiama and I am the Managing Trustee of This Ability Trust. I founded This Ability in 2012, and our focus has always been advancing the rights of women with disability. This whole Corona virus thing got us thinking in terms of how communities a woman with disabilities are responding, whether this information is reaching them whether they have the necessary skills support and resources to navigate through this pandemic. But also on the flip side, we were thinking about, you know, the various recommendations that are being given in terms of trying to not get infected, the social distancing the isolation, and how, you know, women who disabilities have had to build these skills over the years because of a very inaccessible environment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">So, can\nwe just get right into it because we would love to know, what is Corona virus\nfrom a medical stand point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Ash<\/em><\/strong>: So, Corona virus, there&#8217;s just too much of information overload about the virus everywhere. As as a lot of us have Reading and hearing about it. But the simple facts of the corona virus is this. The Corona virus is a respiratory virus. It has always existed. But what we are dealing with right now is the novel strain of the corona virus. And it is an exceptionally, very infective infection. It started in China. It&#8217;s a it&#8217;s a zoonotic infection, which means the virus existed when wild animals probably bad and because of the mutation that rendered it very, very effective. It jumped from the bat into the human population, and from then on, it has been increasingly spreading from one person to another at an alarming rate. The common symptoms are very, very common just like any other flu, like fever, upper respiratory, sneezing, cough, and but lung infection. But the one thing that distinguishes the normal coronavirus or the disease The Covid-19 as it&#8217;s called, is that there is a mortality rate of one person, at least one person, but the mortality rate will differ depending on which healthcare setting you are in. A facility in Canada will be very different from a rural facility in India for example, but at this point from whatever data that health authorities have been able to combine, they say that rate of 1% which is very high in a highly populous country like India or some of the countries in Africa, I would assume. So, this is it and it is spreading, it is spreading alarmingly more than 166 countries. From this in December, there was only one. The first case was reported first week of December in China. But today, all 166 countries across the world have reported in some countries more than other countries. So, it is a as we speak, it&#8217;s a global pandemic and it is spending more and more. I think these are the basic facts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie:<\/em><\/strong> Thank\nyou. Thank you Ash, could you maybe speak about those students in India?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Ash<\/em><\/strong>: Yes, we are behind the global epidemic. So, as you know epidemics have four phases one is people who came into from the epicenter people in either China or the very high prevalence countries like France or Italy. So, that is that is the first phase of deployment and the second phase of the epidemic is contacts their family members or anybody that those people who actually tested positive for coronavirus when or who have come into contact with them. So, right now India is only at phase two. We are only seeing new infections. Like all of India, we have 1.3 billion population, but, as of today, the country has notified only around 160 cases. So it&#8217;s very, very early. But in the next week or even the next two weeks we expect, like what the health authorities, the foremost hydrologist in India, dr. john, he said that it&#8217;s going to be an avalanche of cases because of overcrowding, poverty, and lack of access to health care, we are going to have a huge problem on our hands. Right now. Most of the Indian population has heard about it, we&#8217;ll be getting a lot of information. But still we are in a state of denial. We&#8217;re thinking, you know, there&#8217;s just too much. They&#8217;re making a big deal out of it. Because we have, we haven&#8217;t really experienced the, the tragic part of the epidemic so far amongst us. So this is the India&#8217;s and India is again a huge country, hugely diverse population. We speak numerous languages very, very different. Cultural, many cultures in one country. So we have 36 states, each state is like a country is like a European country or even a small African country. So this diverse population, and every state has its own way of dealing with this epidemic. We&#8217;re not seeing the country\u2019s apex body come up, put everyone on board, increase testing, and awareness. See, for example, last week, we had this information that went out and about, you know, coughing and keeping a safe distance, the general precautions, but that was all issued in one language in the only about 25 to 30% of the country speak the language, most of India does not speak Hindi. All our telephones whenever we call we had this call tune and this Hindi message, the most people didn&#8217;t understand. So there&#8217;s, it&#8217;s like, extremely poor coordinated effort by the government and we really don&#8217;t know what is going to happen. We are watching. So every state has its own separate response. Some states are responding better. My state is the southern state of Tamil Nadu, we can&#8217;t say is very poor, but we are also not the best we should do more. So this is India story and, it is frightening, actually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: And\nwhat about the women in the shelter that you you coordinate, you know, what&#8217;s\nthe experience?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Ash<\/em><\/strong>: Yes, the shelter. It&#8217;s very funny, but the women in the shelter are all because we spoke to them about it. And they&#8217;re all the women with disabilities are always on cell phones and they&#8217;re accessing information. So they are, they&#8217;re all aware of this information. We have all the children there. They are the college ones. They are not going out. They&#8217;re staying in the shelter and we are advising the same, you know, hand sanitization and staying at least three feet apart. So, general precautions as of now no symptoms, luckily. So we&#8217;re just waiting, nothing more than that. Also, travel, a lot of the travel is suspended. So a lot of the women who want to go back home, haven&#8217;t gone back home. They&#8217;re just staying at the shelter. So we will wait and see what will happen. We have not been provided masks because masks are in very high demand. Also, it&#8217;s not necessary yet because none of them are having any symptoms. So, but even there is a shortage of hand sanitizer. We as of now we have some stock but we rely on water and soap and stuff like that. So I think we are somewhat prepared. We should be more prepared, but we will. You know, we will get to that level of preparedness. When the when we when we hit that bridge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: So in\nterms of preparedness, you&#8217;re left to your own resources. Is the government\nsupporting you in any way? Absolutely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Ash<\/em><\/strong>: No,\nno, they&#8217;re sending us information, do this clean this and, you know, provide\nmass and do this do this, but they&#8217;re not doing anything they just policing us.\nThe government itself is pretty much confused. There&#8217;s no one person calling\nthe shots there. So no, we are not having that. We&#8217;re not having any support\nfrom the government authorities yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: Okay,\ninteresting. Thank you for that. Thank you for that brief explanation of what&#8217;s\ngoing on in India. Sophie, Hi, would you like to share what&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on\nin the UK. And also, you know, if you&#8217;ve come across any innovative solutions\nthat are connected Persons with Disabilities with this critical information and\naccess to services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Sophie<\/em><\/strong>: It&#8217;s\ngot quite bad over here, as you guys might have seen in the news and the UK now\nis I don&#8217;t know how many cases that we&#8217;ve got. But basically London just gone into\nlockdown. And there&#8217;s a lot of procedures and structures coming into play to\nthat stop people from coming in contact with each other. So government guidance\nhas been very much that we need to socially distance ourselves from each other.\nAnd that&#8217;s meaning a lot of people are working from home. What we have seen,\nunfortunately, is that the government hasn&#8217;t put yet an outright ban on going\ninto some of the public spaces. So for example, pubs and restaurants have been\nadvised not where we&#8217;ve been advised not to go to them, but many people still\nare. And so we&#8217;re expecting there to be a full lockdown kind of in the same way\nthat Italy has seen and it&#8217;s population locked down and kept at home, we were\nexpecting that kind of same measures to start to happening here. But at the\nmoment, there&#8217;s a lot of responsibility being put on the population themselves.\nAnd what that does is leave, because a lot of the responsibility is being put\non the community that the population itself, to self regulate how to manage\nthis, what we&#8217;re seeing is that people are going well, \u201cIt&#8217;s not really my\nproblem. I&#8217;m not vulnerable, I don&#8217;t have a disability, this is for people in\nthe communities that you know, it&#8217;s not me, it means that is putting that\nparticular community a huge risk\u201d. So a lot of disabled people are coming out\ntrying to educate people as to how you know, vulnerable they feel and how\nimportant it is that we all look after each other at this time. And that being\nsaid, it&#8217;s also been really interesting to see how the community here, the\ndisabled community here have responded with advice and guidance on how to best\nmanage being at home and spending time at home and, and actually, you know, we\ndisabled people, disabled women have a lot of experience of being isolated or\nbeing at home of not being able to get to work or having to prioritize their\nhealth over everything else. So as our communities are starting to see and\nexperience the same thing, we are able to say look, we&#8217;ve been here before we\ncan we can help you and don&#8217;t look to us as just vulnerable and you know, the\none that needs to be looked after we in turn who look after you at this point,\nmentally, we can give you tips on how best to you know, structure your day and\nmanage your well being and things so it&#8217;s been a really interesting few days\nand weeks, and of course, it&#8217;s still unfolding and changes are happening\nrapidly every day we&#8217;re getting different government advice. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">So a lot\ngoing on and but to answer your other question about how we&#8217;re sharing\ninformation. And really what&#8217;s being put out there for disabled people. What I\nhave noticed is we are leaning on each other. And we are taking information\nthat is being put out by the government. And we are trying very much to\ndecipher what is relevant to us. As I said before, unfortunately, because the\ngovernment has not issued more hard guideline guidelines yet, a lot of the able\nbodied community is kind of saying, right? Well, that&#8217;s their problem. And that&#8217;s,\nthat&#8217;s leaving us a little bit vulnerable, but we know how to look after each of\nourselves. So we&#8217;re leaning on each other for advice and help and a lot of sort\nof community support networks cropping up so people can help those with\ndisabilities. We&#8217;re seeing really amazing measures such as, you know, pieces of\npaper that are being distributed on social media that you could print off with\ninformation on how to educate people around you. If you have a compromised\nimmune system and you don&#8217;t want to have someone come to your home that could\ninfect you, you know, posters that you can put onto your walls, with\ninformation on how to educate them as to not infect you. So, you know,\ninformation and, and support is really rapidly spreading through social media,\nwhich is really exciting to see and encouraging because it can feel very\nisolating right now. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>:\nThat&#8217;s true. But I love the fact that, we&#8217;re also able to shift that narrative\nfrom, the charity and the vulnerability that mainstream societies used to placing\npeople with disabilities and now we&#8217;re shifting, and saying, that there are actually\nbest practices that, society can borrow from the disability community<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Sophie<\/em><\/strong>: I\nfind it really interesting, you know, I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;ve watched\nyou know, a number of celebrities around the world that I follow on social\nmedia, and they&#8217;re all \u201cDay three or four, and oh, my gosh, I can&#8217;t handle it.\nmelt down, you know, what am I going to do? And I&#8217;m like, hey, I&#8217;ve done this\nyet. You know, it&#8217;s kind of funny, we&#8217;re all sort of going, come on, you know,\nman up here? It\u2019s really interesting. So, actually, whilst you know we&#8217;re\nwatching the world kind of, of course, there&#8217;s very justified to be worried\nabout what&#8217;s happening right now if that fear is justified completely, but the\ncoping with the working from home, it&#8217;s really interesting to watch. Another\nthing and unexpected consequence that is yet to play out and I&#8217;m interested to\nsee is how the world is having to adapt to people working from home and adapt\nto situations which disabled people have been in for a long time. Is that going\nto change the way that businesses actually encounter an organization&#8217;s look\nafter us? Are they going to see now that have that now that they&#8217;ve seen all\ntheir employees to work from home and manage themselves from a different\nworking environment? Does that mean that we&#8217;re going to see different changes\nwhen all this comes to an end? That will mean that disabled people can fit into\nthe workplace a lot more effectively? I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s exciting, but I think\nthere could be silver linings. Let me just say, I do see it&#8217;s interesting\nbecause I mean, I\u2019ve had number of people reach out to me and say, you don&#8217;t\nrealize I lost my job last year because I had to work from home because of\nillness and disability. And now all my colleagues are working from home. you\nknow, the consequences to this are really quite interesting. So, yeah, we&#8217;ll\nsee what happens. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: I&#8217;m\nyeah, I&#8217;m also seeing the fact that you know, there might be a silver lining to\nall this and probably this pandemic will bring us to ground zero and, allow us\nto build systems that are truly inclusive for everyone and that work for\neveryone <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Sophie<\/em><\/strong>:\nAbsolutely and for once, we might see that this vulnerability that we all have\nas human beings, but many take for granted. We can see that the disabled who\nlive with this can think in a very different way. I mean, it really could bring\nto the to the forefront a different perspective, that vulnerability is\nstrength. That opportunity is found in adversity and disabled people are so\nresilient. And so adaptive when it comes to having to live in a world that\ndoesn&#8217;t suit their needs, what can we teach the wider world about that? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">One thing I was interested in hearing you talk about as just then is disabled women, you were saying a lot of people are on their phones. And I don&#8217;t know about you guys, but I&#8217;m on my phone right now. All the time. I mean, everyone&#8217;s saying it&#8217;s not healthy to spend a huge amount of time on social media, but that&#8217;s just really hard to do to not be on it all the time. And I wanted to know if any of you have found a really good hashtag or one place the way we can disseminate information through. At the moment with you know that I haven&#8217;t seen that here in the UK. It&#8217;s more we&#8217;re sharing accounts or people that might have a good voice or if you have charities or DPOs that know a little bit more, we can signpost to that. But have you seen anything a bit more disability focused?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Ash<\/em><\/strong>: To\nanswer Sophie\u2019s question on, you know, whether there&#8217;s anything specifically\nfor information on disability and the epidemic right now. A bunch of us we call\nourselves the Disability Rights Alliance in India, activists from all over\nIndia it&#8217;s a very loose social group, Social Media Group. So we put out a\nwebsite on WordPress, it&#8217;s a very small blog, we call it the AIDER or\nAddressing and Including Diversity in Emergency Response, just a one page\nwebsite but it contains all the links from government sources WHO, CDC etc. With\nsome information very little, we just wanted to put everything in one place. So\nwe will be adding to this, so this is an effort from the disability community\nfor you know, providing information for someone with a disability and coping\nwith the current situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Sophie<\/em><\/strong>: That&#8217;s\nreally thanks for like, I&#8217;d love to share that here in the UK as well. And I of\ncourse after this, we can all connect and share what we&#8217;ve got resource wise I\njust feel there should be a global coming together of all of us like we are\nhere now doing that we should bring in as many partners we are all connected\nto, because I do feel that the disabled community whilst we are being talked\nabout as being the most vulnerable, especially here in the UK. That&#8217;s the\nconversation at the moment is that this virus is particularly threatening to\nthat group of people. Everyone&#8217;s talking about disabled people and vulnerable\npeople. It&#8217;s very important that the information gets to those particular\npeople and that those people speak for themselves about what&#8217;s going on and\nwhat they need to learn. So yeah, and<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Ash<\/em><\/strong>: Like you\nall mentioned, I did a search on Twitter, disability and the current situation,\nand the only thing that it threw for me was this work from home. You know, lots\nof people are talking about how people with disability have always propagated\nworking from home and how it is so doable. So this is the only context in which\ndisability is appearing on Twitter feeds here in India. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Maria\nRosa<\/em><\/strong>: I want to add just something little because what I think\nis that we also need to be specific about how women with disability not only\nnot all people with disabilities, is like how women are handling handle it.\nSorry, and I think I mean, there are two important things, actually woman women\nwith disability usually, I mean, are more isolated than men with disabilities.\nAnd actually, I mean, I can talk a little bit about Kenya, about Latin America them\nusually do the care job at their homes. So now, I think for some of them, it is\ntrue, there is a now we have the opportunity to learn about how to handle the\nisolation, also true that some of them are in really vulnerable conditions.\nActually, I was reading something the last week about how women with disability\nare trying to handle the violence at home. I mean, the gender based violence at\nhome, because now that in some countries, everybody&#8217;s at home all the day, they\nget anxious, and usually the violence is against them. So I can tell you, for\nexample, and I think that&#8217;s important to maybe, to share, in Colombia, they\nopen a hotline and there are women with disability. I mean, picking the phone,\nbut they are giving support to other women with disability who are suffering violence\ninside home. And I think it&#8217;s very important to share this kind of experience\nbecause in some point, maybe we should start with those things like that.\nBecause, women are not in the same situation than men with disability in the\nmiddle of this crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Sophie<\/em><\/strong>: Really\ngood point. I mean, all of the issues that women in general are facing now in\nincreased violence, gender based violence, disabled women are\ndisproportionately affected by that I can. I think that&#8217;s such a valid point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Maria\nRosa<\/em><\/strong>: And actually, for example, in some countries in South\nAmerica, when somebody needs to go to the hospital is know the woman. They lead\nthe woman for the second of the third option, and when a man is sick, everybody\ngoes with him to the hospital, but when we when it&#8217;s about women, they don&#8217;t\nhave the same story. To go down to the hospital. So yeah, I think, like woman\nin different conditions than men, and for sure women and girls with disability,\nare in a more vulnerable conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: Yeah,\nthat&#8217;s definitely true. I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;m not sure, like what is in place in terms\nof, you know, emergency preparedness from your various governments, but I can\nspeak for Kenya. And, you know, the women with disabilities are virtually\ninvisible in, you know, programming and policy. So, to even allocate budgets\nthat speak to the reality of women with disabilities and their needs is non\nexistent. In refugee camps, for example, you know, things like issues around\nsexual and reproductive health are not taken into consideration, because it&#8217;s\nnot something you know, the government has prepared for us. I&#8217;m curious about\nwhat your governments, your specific governments are doing from a social\nprotection standpoint to ensure that maybe not only women have disabilities,\nbut women in general are able to access services that they need on a day to\nday. Is there anything in India or the UK or Ecuador?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Sophie<\/em><\/strong>: Well,\nspeaking from the UK, I have to say that we are in emergency response mode, it\nseems here so I, as far as I&#8217;m aware, so little is being done, measures being\nput in place, but it&#8217;s got to be done quicker. And of course, the community\nitself is recognizing that women with disabilities and girls with disabilities\nare disproportionately more affected by things like Gender-based violence. And\nso therefore, everything that&#8217;s going on right now, just we&#8217;re particularly\nvulnerable, but the problem is is that we&#8217;ve got so much to deal with the\ncountry is in lockdown is in panic, the army\u2019s being brought into London to\nstop controlling people. It is, really that, rapid response. So, the answer is\nfrom me here. I think that we&#8217;re not there yet. We&#8217;re not ready yet. We aren&#8217;t\nprepared to help. And we&#8217;re doing the best that we can, of course, but I don&#8217;t.\nI mean, I say we, the government is doing. Yeah. But you know, it&#8217;s early days.\nAnd of course, at the moment, the real experience is a terrifying one for so\nmany disabled people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Clarence<\/em><\/strong>:\nLizzie, we can also see that the government is trying to train the nurses on\nhow to handle the coronavirus but for women with disabilities. When you go to\nthe hospitals you can confirm that there&#8217;s no there&#8217;s no sign language\ninterpreters for the Deaf. This is no accurate accessibility of the hospitals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: Yeah, that is a reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Millicent<\/em><\/strong>: You\nfind the women, they go and fetch water from the river. And then here they&#8217;re\nbeing told you need to wash your hands with running water. So this is a woman\nwith disability who depends on somebody else for such kind of services. So what\nis the government and you know, with all the money that is coming in, they have\nnot even thought about this kind of this part of the population of Kenya, that\nthey need to be included in whatever budgetary allocations that are taking\nplace, whatever aid that is coming in to fight this, this particular issue,\nepidemic, because you&#8217;re being taught to sanitize, even in the urban areas, the\nmiddle income earning class, like know, the prices for the sanitizers have\nreally skyrocketed. They&#8217;re not even available. So how is the government\nexpecting a woman in the village to be able to access this kind of thing. So, I\nalso believe that the ultimate information is being passed. It is to elite. It\nis not really speaking to our women with disabilities in their real actual,\nit&#8217;s not real. It&#8217;s a bit up there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Sophie<\/em><\/strong>: As\nsimilar stories being told here in the UK that that even though Yeah, like you\nsay that the hand sanitizers are being bought by other people and women with\ndisabilities and people with disabilities are not being able to get access to\nthat either. And, actually, you know, masks have been taken up, all of the\nresources and all of the things that are needed. For the day to day, lives of\ndisabled people are being taken away, or the prices being put up. And other\npeople are stockpiling and hoarding that and taking it away from people. So the\ngovernment might be putting measures in place, but other people are taking\nadvantage of it. So still, once again, disabled people are being left behind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: And\nalso how this information is spreading, like I&#8217;m on social media. So, I get a\nlot of information like on Twitter, and, other social media platforms, but very\nlimited information is being shared on mobile phones, the majority of the\npopulation in Kenya has access to those. But Internet, if you&#8217;re in a remote\narea, you don&#8217;t have, access to internet so even how this information is being\nshared <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Sophie<\/em><\/strong>: Over\nhere in the UK is that people are like I said earlier, they are realizing that\nthat there are people hidden away thousands of people are hidden away with\ndisabilities, now that everyone&#8217;s retreating into their own homes. So there is\na more of an awareness or a sympathy, but still, the resources aren&#8217;t going to\nget to those people without the right, the right support to get to them. If\nthat makes sense. It&#8217;s still, you know, there&#8217;s an awareness being raised, but\nyet people still don&#8217;t know how to get the resources there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Ash<\/em><\/strong>: I\njust want to jump in right now and talk about how social distancing in some\ncontext for people with high care needs like a child with the cerebral palsy or\nsomebody who&#8217;s completely dependent on caregiver for everyday living by family\nmembers or somebody assisting them? How are we going to do the social\ndistancing? How is that going to work? So there&#8217;s no word about it. You know,\nanywhere any Advisory has not come up. Just a mention about how that can be\ndone is not there. So I find that extremely, you know, upsetting. So, that&#8217;s\none thing and also, I&#8217;m wondering about when we go into isolation about our\nmental health. Somebody who&#8217;s isolated, what I mean, how it&#8217;s going to affect\nsomebody who&#8217;s already having panic<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: Psychosocial\ndisabilities<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Maria<\/em><\/strong> <strong><em>Rosa<\/em><\/strong>:\nDepression actually too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Ash<\/em><\/strong>: Yes,\ndepression. And especially somebody who is suicidal, but you&#8217;re isolated and\nyou need to see somebody. I mean, how&#8217;s that going to work out in the days in\nthe weeks to come? So I&#8217;m just wondering what we are going to uncover here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Sophie<\/em><\/strong>: I\nreally feel it&#8217;s gonna have to come from us. Not government.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: I definitely think that it comes from us. Unfortunately, I actually like the flip side to this whole pandemic is because it&#8217;s allowing, it&#8217;s forcing us to look inward, and to not rely on Big brother to, solve our problems. We have to learn how to be self- reliant. I don&#8217;t think fear should be part of it. We need practical solutions, which we get from our networks. And this could be a network. I don&#8217;t know about the large organizations. I would be wary of, you know, trying to get them, to support because they&#8217;re also looking at the mainstream. You know, they have to solve problems that affect a large group of people and people with disabilities for a long time, they have not considered them a significant population. So why would they start now? I think it&#8217;s on us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Maria\nRosa<\/em><\/strong>: May I jump now? Now is the time I mean, of course, is up\nto this day to guarantee everybody, right. But now it&#8217;s also time to learn\nabout the support networks and I think the feminist and I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m a\nfeminist, but the feminist movement since the last two centuries, can teach\neverybody a lot. I mean, woman, we know how to support each other. And I think\nnow, we cannot wait a lot of the from the States so it&#8217;s not Now, the time to I\nmean, to build support networks all around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Sophie<\/em><\/strong>: So\ncan I ask you in light of that, what would you say is the first what is the\ninformation that you think we need to spread first? Is it about the basics of\nhow to protect yourself and sanitize and look after your well being on the\nbasic level? Is that not getting through? Is it about how to manage when\nyourself isolating? Is it what Where do you think we could start because I feel\nvery much in agreement women can help each other here as disabled women can\nhelp each other in particular. But what do we need to identify? Where do we\nstart?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: For\nme, I think centering women with disabilities in this discourse is critical.\nLike, this things that you know, for example, Ash, what you&#8217;re talking about,\nyou know, a child with cerebral palsy who needs help from a caregiver, and this\ninformation that is being shared by government on how to protect yourself does\nnot include a disability aspect. within this discourse is important, and\nwhatever information is being put out there, whether it&#8217;s sanitation and\nhygiene, and you know, whatever it is, you know, how do we apply a disability\nlens to that, you know, and how do we look at it from a disability perspective,\nyou know, how would a deaf person a blind person, somebody in a wheelchair <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Ash<\/em><\/strong>: with lung\ndisease, exactly how I would be cardiovascular disease?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: Practically,\nhow would they respond to this information? How does it make sense this is just\nmy take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Ash<\/em><\/strong>: I\nwould, first of all emphasize or demand that all government information, their\nwebsites and their announcements today evening, our prime minister said to talk\nto the nation. And I&#8217;m just looking to see that he sent out a PMO officer a\nletter saying we want to sign language interpretation for his for his speech.\nBut again, once country like India, we don&#8217;t have one sign language that\neveryone understands. So there are those challenges there. But we must insist\nthat every information coming out must be inclusive. That&#8217;s one thing and then\ngeneral information. And how do you make all other hand sanitizers? Because\nwashing is again, a very big challenge for a lot of us, especially the limited\nmobility people. So that you must have access to sanitizers and stuff like\nthat. And just generally information itself is more important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Sophie<\/em><\/strong>: I\nthink it&#8217;s so interesting to see how all of the issues that we face, I think\nyou mentioned this before, one of you about how these are issues we&#8217;ve been\nfacing forever lack of communication and the spread of information is, it&#8217;s\nsomething that just cuts disabled people off, you know, if you have any hearing\nimpairment, you&#8217;re not going to get that information. It&#8217;s just compounded\nright now because of the urgency with which we need information. So, I mean, as\nsomebody who uses social media as much as I can I don&#8217;t have a huge following,\nbut I&#8217;m trying to spread as much information as possible. And I think that&#8217;s\nkey, but like, you see so many people without internet, without phones, how do\nwe get to them? And so I&#8217;m hearing it&#8217;s partly we want to lean on our\ngovernment, but partly we want to take control for ourselves and take that give\nthat information so I guess it&#8217;s a joined up effort, isn&#8217;t it? We need both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>All<\/em><\/strong>: It is\na joint effort. Yes, it is. Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Millicent<\/em><\/strong>: Yeah.\nAnd I think we also have to use just our spaces make noise until the government\nhas and does something about it. Because we are because if we don&#8217;t speak out,\nthey will think we are fine. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Clarence<\/em><\/strong>: Okay.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Millicent<\/em><\/strong>: Yeah,\nwe are Okay. I think it&#8217;s a high time that we use to whatever spaces that we\nare in. To call out and make the noise so that they realize that there&#8217;s a\npopulation that is being left behind. And that is equally affected by the\nepidemic, just like everybody else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong><em>Lizzie<\/em><\/strong>: So I\njust want to thank all of you. I hope this was useful this.

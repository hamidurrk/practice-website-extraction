Direct comparison of disability prevalence in 2009 and 2019 is problematic due to differences in data collection methodologies, ages covered, and the size of administrative units.&nbsp;The 2019 census also indicates that 1.9% of men have a disability compared with 2.5% of women. The 2009 census reported 3.4% of men and 3.5% of women had a disability.<a><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/a>Documented studies have shown that due to several causes there is a higher prevalence of disability among women than men, the increased incidence in sexual and gender based violence among women in addition to poor reproductive healthcare services and nutrition, women and girls with disabilities experience disproportionate levels of exclusion due to gender and disability.<a><sup>[2]<\/sup><\/a>The lack of data exacerbates the invisibility of women with disabilities, and for duty bearers and&nbsp;policymakers- it is critical to have the right data to be able to develop the right policies and budgets. With support from UNFPA, This Ability Trust developed a&nbsp;USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data)platform using mobile technology to collect specific data on women with disabilities, to address the lack of data, and to improvethe knowledge onthis specific population.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Long Term Goals<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To increase the visibility of women with disabilities at the national and international level, by improving the quantitative curated data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Short Term Goals<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Ability Trust would like to use the data analysis reports towards policy advocacy and inform the policy makers and duty bearers on the accurate percentage of persons with disabilities segregated into the gender segments of the country\u2019s population.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Overall Objective:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To analyse all the registered&nbsp;data on HESABIKA platform and provide evidence to develop our advocacy campaigns and improve our program implementation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tasks:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To review all the registrations done to date<\/li><li>To analyse the provided data<\/li><li>To develop a report with recommendations<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Responsibilities:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Periodic meetings with This Ability\u2019s team<\/li><li>Analyze data from the HESABIKA platform to establish&nbsp;trends and information.<\/li><li>Link information derived to&nbsp;ongoing and future programs through the Bulk SMS solution<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deliverables:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Methodology for the analysis<\/li><li>Report draft<\/li><li>Final report with conclusions and recommendations<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Required Experience<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Degree in Social Science and or Population Studies<\/li><li>Proven experience in database analysis<\/li><li>Proven knowledge of Kenyan population context<\/li><li>Gender analysis skills<\/li><li>Proven experience in disabilities investigations<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N.B.

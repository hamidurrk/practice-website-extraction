In April 2021, we began outreach within the community. Mama Siri provides an information and referral service to communities of women and girls with disabilities. Women and girls with disabilities from across the country can call 0800 000 300 or text 0799 000 300 and receive critical information on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Gender based violence (where to go for help, what to do in the event of an occurrence)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sexual and Reproductive Health Services (where to go and receive these services)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Legal Information (education on rights of women with disabilities, what legal action to take and where to go for assistance.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mental Health counseling (safe spaces and support for women with disabilities)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The service is the first of its kind in Kenya managed by women with disabilities who understand and empathize with the experiences and challenges of their community. The service was first rolled out in the 8 counties i.e. Kilifi, Mombasa, Kwale, Nairobi, Kajiado, Kakamega, Kisumu and Uasin Gishu where This Ability Trust has active presence and coordinates a network of community based organizations through county focal points. The focal points (Mama Siri responders) were trained on how to handle callers, refer callers, escalate cases and record details for further action. A report is then generated at the end of every two weeks showing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Caller number (names are kept private to protect the caller)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Issue raised<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Referral given<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Outcome<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Follow up action<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Overall Objective:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To develop a training guide for Mama Siris to improve the service quality, with emphasis on how to handle GBV, SHRH cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specific Objectives:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>To equip Mama Siri with skills to be able to do referrals, reporting, recording calls and how to respond to calls.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Develop a training guide on how to handle a toll free referral service for women with disabilities on the following topics:\n<ul>\n<li>Gender and Sexual based Violence&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>SHRH for women with disabilities<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Government Services&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This Ability Trust Programs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide Mama Siris with relevant information on Gender based Violence, SRHR and how to provide it,&nbsp; from a gender and disabilities right standpoint.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Develop a step-by-step document on how to handle callers, refer callers, escalate cases and record details for further action.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deliverables:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Needs Assessment and Analysis of Mama Siri<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Draft Guide Overview and content<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Facilitated validation session on findings and guide content<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Final Guide incorporating feedback<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>PowerPoint Presentation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Responsibilities:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Work in partnership with This Ability team to co-create the guide<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>To provide accurate and timely feedback<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>To include This Ability Trust feedback in the report<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Requirements:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Social Sciences or Gender degree<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Proven experience working in SGBV and SRHR services and information&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Previous experience working with women with disabilities<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Knowledge of the local Kenyan Context<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u200b\u200bApplication Instructions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please send your expression of interest to consultant@this-ability.org on or before Friday 10th March 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Late applications will not be accepted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>N.B.

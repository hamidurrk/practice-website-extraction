Our main objective is to amplify the voices and increase visibility of women and girls with disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>Problem Statement<\/strong><br>This Ability Trust has been investing in leveraging technology across all our programmatic activities. We have dedicated our resources to ensuring the development and successful launch of the Mama Siri, SKILLS and Hesabika programs which use various forms of technology ranging from USSD mobile technology, e-Learning, toll free and bulk sms platforms. These programs have been launched in the 8 counties where This Ability Trust is active, and has been successfully meeting the needs of women and girls with disabilities. Over the last 6 months, SKILLS, Mama Siri and Hesabika have struggled to gain popularity and uptake in Kajiado county. The numbers reported from Kajiado are a fraction in comparison to other counties. In addition, out of the 3 Digital Dada cohorts, we are yet to receive an application from Kajiado county. Though it is&nbsp; understood that Kajiado county is very vast and sparsely populated, the uptake has been low despite reports showing&nbsp; the service is greatly required there. This Ability Trust recognizes the unique cultural and social setting of Kajiado county and would like to embark on a below the line (btl) campaign to strengthen our impact in Kajiado county.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>i) SKILLS&nbsp;<\/strong><br>Our elearning platform was developed from an inclusive and accessible approach, the platform was built with the needs of women with different disabilities at the core.&nbsp; SKILLS allows participants to access content, interact with each other as well as interact with administrators for any assistance that may be needed. As SKILLS is entirely virtual, it offers a unique opportunity to be able to expand it to include various other disciplines. Course content can also be changed on the go. The platform offers a text to speech function, grey scale text and text enlargement function for persons with visual and hearing impairments.<br><strong>ii) HESABIKA<\/strong><br>This Ability Trust developed a USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) platform using mobile technology to collect specific data on women with disabilities, to address the lack of data and to improve the knowledge on women with disabilities demographic data. We have to date registered over 15,000 men, women and children with disabilities on our platform across the country. To successfully&nbsp; continue to achieve this, we are continuously conducting mobilization campaigns to create awareness among communities of women with disabilities across 8 counties (Kajiado, Nairobi, Kisumu, Kakamega, Uasin Gishu, Kilifi, Kwale and Mombasa). The data acquired is being used to build evidence to influence policy advocacy on the rights of women with disabilities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iii)MAMA SIRI<\/strong><br>Our toll free service solution that allows women with disabilities throughout the country to call 0800 000 300 and receive referral assistance on Gender based violence (where to go for help, what to do in the event of an occurrence), Sexual and Reproductive Health Services (where to go and receive these services), Legal Information (education on rights of women with disabilities, what legal action to take and where to go for assistance.) and Mental Health counseling (safe spaces and support for women with disabilities). The service is the first of its kind in Kenya spearheaded by women with disabilities who understand and empathize with the experiences and challenges of their counterparts that call in. The service was first rolled out in the 8 counties i.e. Kilifi, Mombasa, Kwale, Nairobi, Kajiado, Kakamega, Kisumu and Uasin Gishu where This Ability Trust has an active presence and coordinates a network of community based organizations through county focal points. The focal points (Mama Siri responders) were trained on how to handle callers, refer callers, escalate cases and record details for further action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Overall Objective:&nbsp;<\/strong><br>To co-create and execute a Below the Line (BTL) strategy and campaign for our programs targeting&nbsp; women and girls with disabilities as well as the general public in Kajiado County.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>Specific Objective<\/strong><br>To create awareness on our programs and increase reach and impact in Kajiado County.<br>To understand and internalize This Ability Trust\u2019s key messages, preferred language, founding pillars, medium to long term strategy and code of conduct in detail and align the campaign proposal and execution accordingly.<br>To provide timely feedback to This Ability Trust team and advise on trend changes, on ground observations and best practices to achieve set objectives.<br>To provide a custom made daily performance tracking matrix that allows detailed monitoring and evaluation while in Kajiado County.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deliverables:<\/strong><br>A customized comprehensive go-to-market BTL strategy for SKILLS, HESABIKA and MAMA SIRI in Kajiado County created for our existing and future engagements.<br>A detailed schedule and budget of the proposed BTL strategy.<br><strong>Responsibilities:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work in partnership with This Ability Trust team from design to execution of the BTL campaign in Kajiado County.<br>To provide accurate and timely feedback<br>Ensure that branding and staff conduct are in line with This Ability Trust\u2019s acceptable standards of representation.<br>Field data collection and reporting<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Required Experience:<\/strong><br>Evidence of existing in-house policy in support of women and girls with disabilities or persons with disabilities in general.<br>Evidence of projects execution team training regime.<br>Evidence of work successfully completed with other NGO\u2019s or social enterprise organizations.<br>Evidence of an active and versatile creative department.&nbsp;<br>Strong M&amp;E evidence<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Exclusion Clause&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Ability Trust has zero tolerance for corruption and fraud.&nbsp;<\/em><br><em>This Ability Trust reserves the right to offer comparable assignments to those qualified candidates that may not have been selected for this consultancy assignment for which they applied for.

Our main objective is to amplify the voices and increase visibility of women and girls with disabilities.<br><strong>Background<\/strong><br>UNICEF and the WHO define menstrual hygiene management as \u201cWomen and adolescent girls using a clean menstrual management material to absorb or collect blood that can be changed in privacy as often as necessary for the duration of the menstruation period, using soap and water for washing the body as required, and having access to facilities to dispose of used menstrual management materials. They understand the basic facts linked to the menstrual cycle and how to manage it with dignity and without discomfort or fear\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Menstrual hygiene management also involves addressing harmful societal beliefs and taboos surrounding the issue. This definition applies also for women and girls with disabilities. One quarter of the global population is of menstruating age, yet menstruation is shrouded in discrimination and taboos. Disability also carries stigma, so women with disabilities may face layers of discrimination when menstruating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a widespread misconception that women with disabilities are asexual, so they do not receive information on sexual and reproductive health and how to manage their periods independently. When it is about their menstruation, they face several barriers, such as lack of right information, menstrual products are very costly, communication barriers and cultural stigma. For some women and girls with disabilities menstruation can be a very traumatic experience. The intersection between cultural stigma, gender and disability puts women and girls with disabilities under vulnerable conditions and exclusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project Overview<\/strong><br>UNFPA is implementing a 6 months Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) project in drought affected areas. Under this project, This Ability Trust is advancing the rights of women with disabilities through distribution of hygiene kits to women and girls with disabilities of reproductive age in drought prone areas such as Kilifi, Kwale, Kajiado and Tana River Counties. This Ability will collaborate with partners such as Kenya Red Cross in mobilisation of women and girls with disabilities in some of the drought affected communities in efforts to enhance menstrual hygiene and dignity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Overall Objective:<\/strong><br>To increase access of women and girls with disabilities to proper menstrual and bodily hygiene products.<br>Deliverables:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>1.

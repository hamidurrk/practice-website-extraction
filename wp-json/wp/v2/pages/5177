We envision a society in which women and girls with disabilities live fully integrated lives socially, economically and politically, with their rights respected and upheld. We work to increase access to sexual and reproductive health rights for women and girls with disabilities in Kenya, South Sudan and The Gambia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Women and girls with disabilities are among groups at higher risk of violence given the intersectional discrimination and exclusion, based on their gender and disability, among other status, which include attitudinal, environmental and institutional barriers. A 2012 study found that women and girls with disabilities are three times at greater risk of rape, are twice as likely to be survivors of domestic violence and other forms of gender-based violence and are likely to experience abuse over a longer period and with more severe injuries than women without disabilities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 15% of the world&#8217;s population has a disability, translating to over one billion people globally. The WHO 2011 World Report on Disability found that the female disability prevalence rate is 19.2%.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For This Ability, this means women and girls with disabilities must be at the center of efforts to end violence against women and girls. Our work focuses on the intersection of Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights and economic rights, climate justice, governance, education and technology. Our programmatic goals, outputs and outcomes are linked and contribute to our four strategic pillars on Empowerment, Advocacy, Social Norms and Sustainability through our main programs listed below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/this-ability.org\/mama-siri\/\">Mama Siri<\/a> is our GBV and SRH toll free referral service for women with disabilities by women with disabilities.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/members.this-ability.org\/dashboard\">Hesabika<\/a>, is our USSD registration platform that allows persons with disabilities to self register from any basic application based phone via the short code *548#<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/skills.this-ability.org\/\">Skills<\/a>, is our eLearning platform that offers capacity building content to women with disabilities and other stakeholders.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.this-ability.org\/srhrplusd-festival\/\">SRHRplusD Festival<\/a>, is our 5 day community festival celebrating the bodily autonomy of women and girls with disabilities<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Role<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Project Officer (PO) will be responsible for supporting project implementation of This Ability Trust projects across the country.

Board meetings are held at This Ability Trust hub in Thogoto, Kikuyu and via teleconference (for up to 2 hours) from time to time.

A Board of Trustees governs This Ability Trust. Its operation is overseen by a Managing Trustee who is supported by a Management Team, coordinating the Projects, Finance and Administration of the Trust. The organization also employs Project Officers who support the implementation projects to communities of women with disability across Kenya. This Ability Trust hub is in Thogoto, Kikuyu, Kiambu county, however, it delivers its services to women and girls with disability across Kenya.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Ability responds to the prevalent violence experienced by communities of women and girls with disabilities due to intersectional discrimination and exclusion. Studies found that women and girls with disabilities are three times at greater risk of rape, are twice as likely to be survivors of domestic violence and other forms of gender-based violence and are likely to experience abuse over a longer period and with more severe injuries than women without disabilities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 15% of the world&#8217;s population has a disability, translating to over one billion people globally. The average prevalence rate in the female population 18 years and older is 19.2%, compared to 12% for males, representing about 1 in 5 women.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For This Ability, this means women and girls with disabilities must be at the center of efforts to end violence against women and girls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our work has focused on the intersection of Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights and economic rights, climate justice, governance, education and technology.
